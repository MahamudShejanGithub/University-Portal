# University-Portal
This project is a University Portal built with Spring Boot, designed for student interaction and academic course management. It features JWT-based authentication and allows students to:
i. Register and log in securely with JWT
ii. View their profile information
iii. Access current course results
iv. Enroll in new courses, subject to prerequisite validation
The backend is structured using RESTful APIs with a clean, modular architecture. It's a perfect foundation for building modern educational platforms.
